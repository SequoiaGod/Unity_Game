# The Prototype of Game

This game I designed only shows the prototype and the core game mechanism to others.



I'd like to share my thought and my idea on the game design:)
I would say: My passion of game would be the main motivation to keep design my game, although 
there is still have long way to go to complete my first FPS Game,
