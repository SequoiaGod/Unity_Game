# The Prototype of Game


This game I designed only shows the prototype and the core game mechanism to others.
I'd like to share my thought and my idea on the game design:) I would say: My passion for game would be the main motivation to keep designing my game, although there is still have a long way to go to complete my first FPS Game.
